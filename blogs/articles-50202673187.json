I couldn’t look people in the eyes. I had no hygiene practice until I was into my 20s. My clothes were full of holes and usually unwashed.

I was rejected and alone. This was really a fly or die situation.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery leap and bound I made in being a person that could interact positively with another generally came through a very intentional seeking out of advice online (Google and WikiHow), discerning of its appropriateness, and intentional integration into daily life. “How do I talk to strangers?” “What is basic hygiene?” “How to be confident”\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHS Interpretation\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of the first conflicts in my mind I offered to the Holy Spirit. I hated being a person that literally did not understand how to move through society. It was a block that brought up thoughts of lack of confidence when I would even attempt to be social and remedy the perceived problem.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is an understanding I received:\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy \"ground-zero\" understanding of social skills was analogous to my spiritual understanding, my lack thereof.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy years of grinding away at learning something that I perceived as utmost important, \"fly or die\", prepared me for starting at the bottom of learning in a spiritual sense. Just as socially, my spiritual guidance was zero to none externally. I would have to sit, spend time, and figure it out on my own.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of using the internet, I had books and an inner teacher. And even finding the right ones of those took trial, error, and discernment. My practice of seeking advice, filtering the advice through my intuition, and intentional integration of understandings were the exact skills I needed as an early student of A Course in Miracles, literally indispensable.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn being born with this seemingly negative limitation and accepting that I had a choice to change my relationship to it, I learned how to engage with my spiritual in a way that focused on humility, experience-seeking, and understanding.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSituation 2: Lack of relationships\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never understood make-believe as a child.

And pretend to eat them! Like...Danielle, did you eat the egg or not because it is literally still on your plate. You have to put it in your mouth and chew. Say \"Ahh\".. (They didn't invite me back to playtime.)\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis evolved into me being unable to accept “roles” as an adult – student, “best friend”, girlfriend, sister, daughter, subordinate… I just don’t understand what these roles are supposed to\u003cspan\u003e \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edo.\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c\/span\u003eEvery person playing the role opposite of mine – teacher, friend, partner, parent, boss – had their expectations, but all I could see was the arbitrary and needy nature of their expectations. It always felt like make-believe.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, I never felt that they could \"complete me\", or whatever it was that made them need me around; I never shared their needs. If it needs saying, I was not invited back to those relationships where I refused to satisfy the other's \"needs\" (most of them.)

To understand the principles, read below.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003chr style=\"margin: 3em 0;\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. There is no order of difficulty in miracles. One is not \"harder\" or \"bigger\" than another. They are all the same. All expressions of love are maximal.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Miracles as such do not matter. The only thing that matters is their source, which is far beyond evaluation.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. The real miracle is the love that inspires them. In this sense everything that comes from love is a miracle.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. All miracles mean life, and God is the giver of life. His voice will direct you very specifically. You will be told all you need to know.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Miracles are habits, and should be involuntary. They should not be under conscious control. Consciously selected miracles can be misguided.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Miracles are natural. When they do not occur something has gone wrong.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. Miracles are everyone's right, but purification is necessary first.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8. Miracles are healing because they supply a lack; they are performed by those who temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9. Miracles are a kind of exchange. Like all expressions of love, which are always miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. They bring more love both to the giver and the receiver.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10. The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is a misunderstanding of their purpose.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11. Prayer is the medium of miracles. It is a means of communication of the created with the Creator. Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12. Miracles are thoughts. Thoughts can represent the lower or bodily level of experience, or the higher or spiritual level of experience. One makes the physical, and the other creates the spiritual.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13. Miracles are both beginnings and endings, and so they alter the temporal order. They are always affirmations of rebirth, which seem to go back but really go forward. They undo the past in the present, and thus release the future.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14. Miracles bear witness to truth. They are convincing because they arise from conviction. Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive; or rather, the uncreative use of mind.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15. Each day should be devoted to miracles. The purpose of time is to enable you to learn how to use time constructively. It is thus a teaching device and a means to an end. Time will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating learning.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e16. Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating it is as blessed to give as to receive. They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17. Miracles transcend the body. They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from the bodily level. That is why they heal.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18. A miracle is a service. It is the maximal service you can render to another. It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself. You recognize your own and your neighbor's worth simultaneously.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19. Miracles make minds one in God. They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all that God created. Miracles therefore reflect the laws of eternity, not of time.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e20. Miracles reawaken the awareness that the spirit, not the body, is the altar of truth. This is the recognition that leads to the healing power of the miracle.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21. Miracles are natural signs of forgiveness. Through miracles you accept God's forgiveness by extending it to others.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22. Miracles are associated with fear only because of the belief that darkness can hide. You believe that what your physical eyes cannot see does not exist. This leads to a denial of spiritual sight.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23. Miracles rearrange perception and place all levels in true perspective. This is healing because sickness comes from confusing the levels.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24. Miracles enable you to heal the sick and raise the dead because you made sickness and death yourself, and can therefore abolish both. You are a miracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator. Everything else is your own nightmare, and does not exist. Only the creations of light are real.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e25. Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the Atonement. Atonement works all the time and in all the dimensions of time.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26. Miracles represent freedom from fear. \"Atoning\" means \"undoing.\" The undoing of fear is an essential part of the Atonement value of miracles.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e27. A miracle is a universal blessing from God through me to all my brothers. It is the privilege of the forgiven to forgive.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e28. Miracles are a way of earning release from fear. Revelation induces a state in which fear has already been abolished. Miracles are thus a means and revelation is an end.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29. Miracles praise God through you. They praise him by honoring his creations, affirming their perfection. They heal because they deny body-identification and affirm spirit-identification.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30. By recognizing spirit, miracles adjust the levels of perception and show them in proper alignment. This places spirit at the center, where it can communicate directly.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31. Miracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. You should thank God for what you really are. The children of God are holy and the miracle honors their holiness, which can be hidden but never lost.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32. I inspire all miracles, which are really intercessions. They intercede for your holiness and make your perceptions holy. By placing you beyond the physical laws they raise you into the sphere of celestial order. In this order you are perfect.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e33. Miracles honor you because you are lovable. They dispel illusions about yourself and perceive the light in you. They thus atone for your errors by freeing you from your nightmares. By releasing your mind from the imprisonment of your illusions, they restore your sanity.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e34. Miracles restore the mind to its fullness. By atoning for lack they establish perfect protection. The spirit's strength leaves no room for intrusions.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e35. Miracles are expressions of love, but they may not always have observable effects.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36. Miracles are examples of right thinking, aligning your perceptions with truth as God created it.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37. A miracle is a correction introduced into false thinking by me. It acts as a catalyst, breaking up erroneous perception and reorganizing it properly. This places you under the Atonement principle, where perception is healed. Until this has occurred, knowledge of the Divine Order is impossible.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38. The Holy Spirit is the mechanism of miracles. He recognizes both God's creations and your illusions. He separates the true from the false by his ability to perceive totally rather than selectively.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e39. The miracle dissolves error because the Holy Spirit identifies error as false or unreal. This is the same as saying that by perceiving light, darkness automatically disappears.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e40. The miracle acknowledges everyone as your brother and mine. It is a way of perceiving the universal mark of God.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e41. Wholeness is the perceptual content of miracles. They thus correct, or atone for, the faulty perception of lack.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e42. A major contribution of miracles is their strength in releasing you from your false sense of isolation, deprivation and lack.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e43. Miracles arise from a miraculous state of mind, or a state of miracle-readiness.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e44. The miracle is an expression of an inner awareness of Christ and the acceptance of his Atonement.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45. A miracle is never lost. It may touch many people you have not even met, and produce undreamed of changes in situations of which you are not even aware.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e46. The Holy Spirit is the highest communication medium. Miracles do not \u003cbr\u003einvolve this type of communication, because they are temporary communication devices. When you return to your original form of \u003cbr\u003ecommunication with God by direct revelation, the need for miracles is over.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e47. The miracle is a learning device that lessens the need for time. It establishes an out-of-pattern time interval not under the usual laws of time. In this sense it is timeless.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e48. The miracle is the only device at your immediate disposal for controlling time. Only revelation transcends it, having nothing to do with time at all.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e49. The miracle makes no distinction among degrees of misperception. It is a device for perception correction, effective quite apart from either the degree or the direction of the error. This is its true indiscriminateness.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e50. The miracle compares what you have made with creation, accepting what is in accord with it as true, and rejecting what is out of accord as false.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003chr style=\"margin: 3em 0;\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Course in Miracles, Foundation for Inner Peace, chapter 1, section 1\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Jesus\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- alex brady\u003c\/p\u003e","blog_id":50202673187,"author":"alex brady","user_id":40701493283,"published_at":"2020-09-04T23:49:00-06:00","updated_at":"2020-09-05T00:14:51-06:00","summary_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you're going to do miracles, you should understand the principles.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrinciple 1:\u003c\/strong\u003e There is no order of difficulty in miracles.

Do not bring with you one thought the past has taught, nor one belief you ever learned before from anything. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\"\u003eForget this world, forget this course, and come with wholly empty hands unto your God.\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\"\u003etbc\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","blog_id":50202673187,"author":"alex brady","user_id":40701493283,"published_at":null,"updated_at":"2020-07-25T17:39:24-06:00","summary_html":"","template_suffix":null,"handle":"remember-nothing-meditation-technique","tags":"","admin_graphql_api_id":"gid:\/\/shopify\/OnlineStoreArticle\/384657096739","image":{"created_at":"2020-07-25T17:39:24-06:00","alt":"","width":1280,"height":1203,"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0281\/7887\/4403\/articles\/hand_pointing_light_4f7c3541-fbc8-4f65-8281-36bcf35c39ea.png?v=1595720364"}},{"id":384656539683,"title":"Active Listening - A Meditation Technique","created_at":"2020-07-25T15:16:58-06:00","body_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ealex brady loves mind training.
